things for the fgc that would help us:
- do AutoDrive by april tags
- reprogram the sensors: color, distance(from cm to inch - AutoDrive works with inch).
- use LEDS! help to see the color of the gamePiece, we can combine the color sensor to it.
- use the magneticSensor to stop the elevator (in Intake).
- learn how to us the potentiometer sensor. would help solve the power problem in skywalker ( when we start "nain" , the robot isn't moving but we use a lot of power).
- yellow pixel on the board- there is a chance we will need to know how to "locate" objects to make the drive easier.
- More organized telemetry - to print and add data in on place (in SubSystemManger.printStates).



add more missions and tasks if you think it needed, feel free - after we done with mission - to delete it form here.
